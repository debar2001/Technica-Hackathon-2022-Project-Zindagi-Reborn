This is the official repository for Team Noob Masters for Technica Hackathon 2022.




## Problem Statement
Globally, close to 800,000 people die from suicide every year. That’s one person every 40 seconds. This shows, suicide is a big problem which needs to be tackled in an appropriate manner. Despite the efforts from many international organisations, like WHO the suicide rates are increasing day by day.

Social Media has been stigmatised to influence young people to commit suicide, but people’s expression on social media is carefully analysed then it can be used to determine the chances of committing suicide, thus preventing such actions.


## Proposed Solution
We tried to deploy a Natural Language Processing Model that would detect any suicidal thoughts in a person by analysis their social media feeds. For the purpose of demonstration we would use this model in a self-built social media platform. The same model can be used in other major Social Media Platforms like Twitter and Facebook where it could analyse the tweets or posts of individuals to detect any suicidal thoughts.

After in-place detection, the system will automatically raise an alert to the close aids of the person or police or counselling team depending on the level of risk.
